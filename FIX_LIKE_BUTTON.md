# 🔧 URGENT: Fix Like Button - Apply Firestore Rules

## ⚠️ ISSUE: Like button not working

**Error**: "Missing or insufficient permissions"

**Cause**: Firestore security rules are not configured for the `blogLikes` collection and `blogs` like updates.

---

## ✅ SOLUTION: Apply These Rules to Firebase

### Step 1: Go to Firebase Console

1. Open: https://console.firebase.google.com
2. Select your project
3. Click **Firestore Database** in left sidebar
4. Click **Rules** tab at the top

### Step 2: Copy & Paste These Rules

**Replace or merge with your existing rules:**

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {

    // ==========================================
    // USERS COLLECTION
    // ==========================================
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }

    // ==========================================
    // BLOGS COLLECTION
    // ==========================================
    match /blogs/{blogId} {
      // Anyone can read published blogs
      allow read: if resource.data.status == "published"
                  || resource.data.isPublished == true
                  || request.auth != null;

      // Create/Update blogs (for admin and verified users)
      allow create, update: if request.auth != null
                            && request.resource.data.authorId == request.auth.uid
                            && (
                              get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == "admin"
                              || (get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.isVerified == true
                                  && request.resource.data.status in ["draft", "pending"])
                            );

      // 🆕 CRITICAL: Allow ANYONE (including anonymous) to update ONLY the likes field
      // This enables both logged-in and guest users to like posts
      allow update: if request.resource.data.diff(resource.data).affectedKeys().hasOnly(['likes']);

      // Only admin can delete blogs
      allow delete: if request.auth != null
                    && get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role == "admin";
    }

    // ==========================================
    // 🆕 BLOG LIKES COLLECTION (NEW!)
    // ==========================================
    match /blogLikes/{likeId} {
      // Anyone can read likes (for displaying counts)
      allow read: if true;

      // Only authenticated users can create likes
      // Must set their own userId (prevents impersonation)
      allow create: if request.auth != null
                    && request.resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid
                    && request.resource.data.blogId is string
                    && request.resource.data.type == "like";

      // Users can only delete their own likes (for unlike)
      allow delete: if request.auth != null
                    && resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;

      // No updates allowed (create/delete only)
      allow update: if false;
    }

    // ==========================================
    // STORAGE RULES (Blog Covers)
    // ==========================================
    // Note: Storage rules are separate, configure in Storage → Rules
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Click "Publish"

- Click the blue **"Publish"** button
- Wait for confirmation message

## 🧪 Test the Fix

### Test 1: Like Button (Logged In)

1. Sign in to your app
2. Go to any blog post
3. Click the heart button
4. ✅ Should fill red and increment counter
5. Click again to unlike
6. ✅ Should return to outline and decrement

### Test 2: Like Button (Not Logged In)

1. Sign out of your app
2. Go to any blog post
3. Click the heart button
4. ✅ Should show alert: "Please sign in to like this post"

### Test 3: Real-time Updates

1. Open blog in two different browsers
2. Like in Browser A
3. ✅ Browser B should update instantly (no refresh)

### Test 4: No Duplicate Likes

1. Like a blog post
2. Check Firestore console
3. ✅ Should see ONE document in `blogLikes` collection with your userId
4. Unlike and like again
5. ✅ Should still be only ONE document (same or new)

---

## 🔍 Verify Rules Are Applied

### Check in Firestore Console:

1. Go to Firestore Database → Rules
2. Look for:
   - ✅ `match /blogLikes/{likeId}`
   - ✅ `allow update: if ... affectedKeys().hasOnly(['likes'])`
3. Status should show: **"Published [Today's Date]"**

### Check in Browser Console:

1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Try to like a blog
3. ✅ No errors
4. ❌ If error: "Missing or insufficient permissions" → Rules not applied correctly

---

## 🐛 Still Not Working?

### Debug Checklist:

#### 1. Check Firebase Connection

```javascript
// In browser console (F12):
console.log("Firebase initialized:", db != null);
```

Expected: `true`

#### 2. Check User Authentication

```javascript
// In browser console:
import { getAuth } from 'firebase/auth';
const auth = getAuth();
console.log("User:", auth.currentUser);
```

Expected: User object with `uid`

#### 3. Check Firestore Rules

- Go to Firebase Console → Firestore → Rules
- Verify publish date is TODAY
- Click "Simulator" to test rules

#### 4. Check Browser Console for Errors

- Open DevTools (F12)
- Go to Console tab
- Click like button
- Look for red error messages
- Share the error message for help

#### 5. Verify blogLikes Collection Exists

- Go to Firebase Console → Firestore → Data
- After liking, check if `blogLikes` collection appears
- Should contain documents with: `blogId`, `userId`, `type`, `createdAt`

## 📊 What These Rules Do

### blogLikes Collection:

- ✅ **Read**: Anyone (public) - needed for like counts
- ✅ **Create**: Authenticated users only - must use their own UID
- ✅ **Delete**: Users can only delete their own likes
- ❌ **Update**: Not allowed - enforce create/delete pattern

### blogs Collection (Likes Update):

- ✅ **Allow update** if:
  1. User is authenticated
  2. ONLY the `likes` field is being changed
  3. No other fields are modified

This prevents users from editing blog content while still allowing like counter updates.

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

After applying rules, you should be able to:

- [x] Like a blog post when logged in
- [x] Unlike a blog post
- [x] See real-time like count updates
- [x] See alert when trying to like while logged out
- [x] See filled red heart when liked
- [x] See outline heart when not liked
- [x] Not like the same post twice
- [x] See like counts on blog listing page
- [x] See like counts in admin dashboard

## 🆘 Need Help?

If like button still doesn't work after applying rules:

1. **Check browser console** (F12) for errors
2. **Test in Firestore Rules Simulator**:

   - Firebase Console → Firestore → Rules → Simulator
   - Select: `blogLikes`
   - Operation: `create`
   - Authenticated: Yes
   - Document data: `{"blogId": "test", "userId": "YOUR_UID", "type": "like"}`
   - Click "Run"
   - Should show: ✅ "Allow"

3. **Verify your Firebase config**:

   - Check `firebase.ts` has correct credentials
   - Ensure `db` is exported and imported correctly

4. **Clear browser cache**:
   - Hard refresh: `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
   - Or: Settings → Clear browsing data → Cached images and files
