## 🚀 Implementation

### 1. Blog Detail Page

**File**: `app/blogs/[id]/page.tsx`

Already displays like counts with:

```tsx
<Heart className="h-4 w-4" />
<span>{blog.likes || 0}</span>
```

### 3. Admin Dashboard

Shows:

- 📊 Total likes across all blogs
- 🏆 Top 5 most liked articles with ranking
- 🎖️ Medal badges (🥇 Gold, 🥈 Silver, 🥉 Bronze)

---

## 🔒 Firestore Security Rules

### File: `firestore-likes-rules.txt`

**Copy these rules to Firebase Console:**

```javascript
// Blog Likes Collection
match /blogLikes/{likeId} {
  // Anyone can read (for displaying counts)
  allow read: if true;

  // Authenticated users can like
  allow create: if request.auth != null
                && request.resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;

  // Users can unlike their own
  allow delete: if request.auth != null
                && resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;

  // No updates allowed
  allow update: if false;
}

// Blogs Collection (Updated)
match /blogs/{blogId} {
  // Allow updating ONLY the likes field
  allow update: if request.auth != null
                && request.resource.data.diff(resource.data).affectedKeys().hasOnly(['likes']);
}
```

### How to Apply:

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to: **Firestore Database → Rules**
4. Copy rules from `firestore-likes-rules.txt`
5. Merge with existing rules
6. Click **"Publish"**

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Missing or insufficient permissions"

**Solution**: Apply Firestore rules from `firestore-likes-rules.txt`

### Issue: Like count not updating

**Cause**: Real-time listener not set up
**Solution**: Component uses `onSnapshot` - ensure Firebase connection is active

### Issue: User can like multiple times

**Cause**: Security rules not applied
**Solution**:

1. Check rules in Firebase Console
2. Ensure `userId` validation is in place
3. Component checks for existing like before creating

### Issue: Button not showing liked state

**Cause**: `useEffect` dependencies may be stale
**Solution**: Component re-checks on user/blogId change

---

## 🎯 Best Practices

### 1. **Performance**

- ✅ Uses real-time listeners (efficient)
- ✅ Optimistic UI updates (instant feedback)
- ✅ Minimal re-renders with proper state management

### 2. **Security**

- ✅ Server-side validation via Firestore rules
- ✅ User can only create/delete their own likes
- ✅ No client-side trust (all verified server-side)

### 3. **UX**

- ✅ Clear visual feedback (filled heart)
- ✅ Disabled state during loading
- ✅ Helpful error messages
- ✅ Authentication prompt for guests

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

### Potential Features:

1. **Like Animation** - Heart pop animation on click
2. **Like History** - Show who liked a post (admin only)
3. **Like Notifications** - Notify author when post gets liked
4. **Like Analytics** - Track likes over time (chart)
5. **Reactions** - Add more reactions (love, fire, clap)
6. **Unlike Animation** - Reverse animation when unliking
